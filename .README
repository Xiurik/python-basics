# Install Required Packages

To install all the packages required for the project, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Create a requirements.txt file

To create a requirements.txt file, run the following command depending of the OS you are running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements-mac.txt

pip freeze > requirements-win.txt
```

# Get a list of all the outdated packages

```bash
pip list --outdated
```

# Update all the packages in one shoot

To update all the packages we will generate a requirements.txt file and replace the == with >=, then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

After that, we will rebuild again the requirements.txt file running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

# Update a single package

```bash
pip install -U <package_name>
```
